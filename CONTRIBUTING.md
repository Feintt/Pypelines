# Contributing to Pypelines

Contributions are what make the open-source community an incredible place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions to "Pypelines" are greatly appreciated.

Before making any substantial changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Communication

If you have a question or have found a bug, feel free to open an issue. For more detailed discussions or sharing ideas, please contact the project maintainers via email or any other method specified by them.

## We love pull requests, and we welcome them heartily. Here's a quick guide:

1. **Create an issue (if it doesn't exist yet)**: If you've found a bug or have an idea for a new feature you want to hack on, start by making sure there's an issue for it.
2. **Fork the repo, then create a branch**: Fork the project and create a branch from `main` (or 'master' if 'main' is not present) for your issue. Make your changes in this branch.
3. **Test your changes**: Ensure that your changes do not break any tests and check if you can write new tests for your changes. Run the existing test suites and potentially consider adding new ones related to your changes.
4. **Document any changes to the interface**: If you're adding or changing any public APIs or features, update the README.md or any relevant documentation.
5. **Push to your fork and submit a pull request**: Push to your fork, and then submit a pull request. In the pull request, choose a title that summarizes what you've done, and in the body, provide more details about what your changes entail. Include references to relevant issues (like "Closes #4" or "Fixes #8").
6. **Wait for review**: One of the maintainers will review your pull request and respond. If everything looks good, they'll merge it! Otherwise, they may ask for some changes. We're all very friendly and committed to making this process as smooth as possible for contributors.
7. **Versioning**: Please do not update the version number in your pull requests (leave that for project maintainers). Adhere to the Semantic Versioning guidelines.

## Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. Please read the Code of Conduct for details on our code of conduct.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at `mauricio_chavarria_25@hotmail.com`. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
